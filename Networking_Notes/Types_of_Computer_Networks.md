# Types of Computer Networks 
---
## Personal Area Network 
* PAN is a computer network formed around a person. 
* It generally consists of a computer, mobile, or personal digital assistant. 
* used for establishing communication among these personal devices for connecting to a digital network and the internet. 
 
 ### Characteristics of PAN 
* It is mostly personal devices network equipped within a limited area. 
* Allows you to handle the interconnection of IT devices at the surrounding of a single user. 
* PAN includes mobile devices, tablet, and laptop. 
* It can be wirelessly connected to the internet called WPAN. 
* Appliances use for PAN: cordless mice, keyboards, and Bluetooth systems. 
 
### Advantages of PAN 
* PAN networks are relatively secure and safe 
* offers only short-range solution up to ten meters 
* Strictly restricted to a small area 
 
### Disadvantages of PAN  
* may establish a bad connection to other networks at the same radio bands. 
* Distance limits.

## Local Area Network 
* A Local Area Network (LAN) is a group of computer and peripheral devices which are connected in a limited area such as school, laboratory, home, and office building. 
* It is a widely useful network for sharing resources like files, printers, games, and other applications. 
* The simplest type of LAN network is to connect computers and a printer in someone's home or office.  
* It is a network which consists of less than 5000 interconnected devices across several buildings. 

### Characteristics of LAN 
* It is a private network, so an outside regulatory body never controls it. 
* LAN operates at a relatively higher speed compared to other WAN systems. 
* There are various kinds of media access control methods like token ring and Ethernet. 

### Advantages of LAN  
* Computer resources like hard-disks, DVD-ROM, and printers can share local area networks. 
* You can use the same software over the network instead of purchasing the licensed software for each client in the network. 
* Data of all network users can be stored on a single hard disk of the server computer. 
* You can easily transfer data and messages over networked computers. 
* It will be easy to manage data at only one place, which makes data more secure. 
* Local Area Network offers the facility to share a single internet connection among all the LAN users. 

### Disadvantages of LAN 
* the initial cost of installing Local Area Networks is quite high. 
* The LAN admin can check personal data files of every LAN user, so it does not offer good privacy. 
* Unauthorized users can access critical data of an organization in case LAN admin is not able to secure a centralized data repository. 
* Local Area Network requires a constant LAN administration as there are issues related to software setup and hardware failures

## Wide Area Network 
* WAN (Wide Area Network) is spread across a large geographical area. 
* WAN network system could be a connection of a LAN which connects with other LAN's using telephone lines and radio waves. 
* It is mostly limited to an enterprise or an organization. 
 
### Characteristics of WAN: 
* The software files will be shared among all the users; therefore, all can access the latest files. 
* Any organization can form its global integrated network using WAN. 
 
### Advantages of WAN 
* WAN helps you to cover a larger geographical area.
* Contains devices like mobile phones, laptop, tablet, computers, gaming consoles, etc. 
* WLAN connections work using radio transmitters and receivers built into client devices. 
 
### Disadvantage of WAN 
* The initial setup cost of investment is very high. 
* It is difficult to maintain the WAN network. You need skilled technicians and network administrators. 
* There are more errors and issues because of the wide coverage and the use of different technologies. 
* It requires more time to resolve issues because of the involvement of multiple wired and wireless technologies. 
* Offers lower security compared to other types of networks.

## WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) 
* WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) helps you to link single or multiple devices using wireless communication within a limited area like home, school, or office building. 
* It gives users an ability to move around within a local coverage area which may be connected to the network. 
* most modern day's WLAN systems are based on IEEE 802.11 standards. 
	* In 1997, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers created the first WLAN standard. 
	* They called it 802.11 after the name of the group formed to oversee its development. 
	* 802.11 only supported a maximum network bandwidth of 2 Mbpsâ€”too slow for most applications.
	* ordinary 802.11 wireless products are no longer manufactured. 
	* The best way to look at these standards is to consider 802.11 as the foundation, and all other iterations as building blocks upon that foundation that focus on improving both small and large aspects of the technology. Some building blocks are minor touch-ups while others are quite large. 
* The largest changes to wireless standards come when the standards are "rolled up" to include most or all small updates. So, for example, the most recent rollup occurred in December 2016 with 802.112016. Since then, however, minor updates are still occurring and, eventually, another large roll-up will encompass them. 

* Below is a brief look at the most recently approved iterations, outlined from newest to oldest. Other iterations, like 802.11be (Wi-Fi 7), are still in the approval process. 
 
- 802.11ax: Branded as Wi-Fi 6, the 802.11ax standard went live in 2019 and will replace 802.11ac as the de facto wireless standard. Wi-Fi 6 maxes out at 10 Gbps, uses less power, is more reliable in congested environments, and supports better security. 
 
- 802.11aj: Known as the China Millimeter Wave, this standard applies in China and is basically a rebranding of 802.11ad for use in certain areas of the world. The goal is to maintain backward compatibility with 802.11ad. 
 
- 802.11ah: Approved in May 2017, this standard targets lower energy consumption and creates extended-range Wi-Fi networks that can go beyond the reach of a typical 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz networks. It is expected to compete with Bluetooth given its lower power needs. 
 
 
- 802.11ad: Approved in December 2012, this standard is freakishly fast. However, the client device must be located within 30 feet of the access point. 
Keep in mind when distances are mentioned that ranges can be greatly impacted by obstacles that block the signal, so the range mentioned refers to situations where there is absolutely no interference. 
 
- 802.11ac: The generation of Wi-Fi that first signalled popular use, 802.11ac uses dual-band wireless technology, supporting simultaneous connections on both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz Wi-Fi devices. 802.11ac offers backward compatibility to 802.11a/b/g/n and bandwidth rated up to 1300 Mbps on the 5 GHz band plus up to 450 Mbps on 2.4 GHz. Most home wireless routers are compliant with this standard. 
802.11ac is the most expensive to implement; performance improvements only noticeable in high bandwidth applications 
 
- 802.11n: 802.11n (also sometimes known as Wireless N) was designed to improve on 802.11g in the amount of bandwidth it supports, by using several wireless signals and antennas (called MIMO technology) instead of one. Industry standards groups ratified 802.11n in 2009 with specifications providing for up to 600 Mbps of network bandwidth. 802.11n also offers a somewhat better range over earlier Wi-Fi standards due to its increased signal intensity, and it is backward-compatible with 802.11a/b/g gear. 
	* Pros of 802.11n: Significant bandwidth improvement from previous standards; wide support across devices and network gear 
	* Cons of 802.11n: More expensive to implement than 802.11g; use of multiple signals may interfere with nearby 802.11b/g based networks 
 
- 802.11g: In 2002 and 2003, WLAN products supporting a newer standard called 802.11g emerged on the market. 802.11g attempts to combine the best of both 802.11a and 802.11b. 802.11g supports bandwidth up to 54 Mbps, and it uses the 2.4 GHz frequency for greater range. 802.11g is backward compatible with 802.11b, meaning that 802.11g access points will work with 802.11b wireless network adapters and vice versa. 
	* Pros of 802.11g: Supported by essentially all wireless devices and network equipment in use today; least expensive option 
	* Cons of 802.11g: Entire network slows to match any 802.11b devices on the network; slowest/oldest standard still in use 
 
- 802.11a: While 802.11b was in development, IEEE created a second extension to the original 802.11 standard called 802.11a. Because 802.11b gained in popularity much faster than did 802.11a, some folks believe that 802.11a was created after 802.11b. In fact, 802.11a was created at the same time. Due to its higher cost, 802.11a is usually found on business networks whereas 802.11b better serves the home market. 
802.11a supports bandwidth up to 54 Mbps and signals in a regulated frequency spectrum around 5 GHz. This higher frequency compared to 802.11b shortens the range of 802.11a networks. The higher frequency also means 802.11a signals have more difficulty penetrating walls and other obstructions. 
 
Because 802.11a and 802.11b use different frequencies, the two technologies are incompatible with each other. Some vendors offer hybrid 802.11a/b network gear, but these products merely implement the two standards side by side (each connected device must use one or the other). 
 
- 802.11b: IEEE expanded on the original 802.11 standard in July 1999, creating the 802.11b specification. 802.11b supports a theoretical speed up to 11 Mbps. A more realistic bandwidth of 2 Mbps (TCP) and 3 Mbps (UDP) should be expected. 
802.11b uses the same unregulated radio signaling frequency (2.4 GHz) as the original 802.11 standard. Vendors often prefer using these frequencies to lower their production costs. Being unregulated, 802.11b gear can incur interference from microwave ovens, cordless phones, and other appliances using the same 2.4 GHz range. However, by installing 802.11b gear a reasonable distance from other appliances, interference can easily be avoided.
