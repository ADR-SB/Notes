### What is a Network? 

* A network consists of two or more computers that are linked in order to share resources (such as printers and CDs), exchange files, or allow electronic communications.
* The computers on a network may be linked through cables, telephone lines, radio waves, satellites, or infrared light beams.
* Below is a list of points that we do with the help of computer networks, or things that we benefit from with the help of computer networks or that have become possible or effective due to computer networks. Provides the best way of business communication.
