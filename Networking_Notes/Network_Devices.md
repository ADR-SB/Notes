# Different types of networking devices :
### Hub: 
* A hub is a basic networking device that connects multiple Ethernet devices together.
* typically using twisted pair or fiber optic cables. 
* It operates at the physical layer of the OSI model and simply broadcasts data to all connected devices. 
* Hubs are often considered obsolete and have been largely replaced by switches.

### Switch: 
* A switch is a networking device that connects multiple devices within a local area network (LAN). 
* It operates at the data link layer of the OSI model and uses MAC addresses to forward data only to the intended recipient device. 
* Switches are more efficient than hubs because they create dedicated connections between devices, reducing network congestion and improving performance.

### Repeater: 
* A repeater is a device used to regenerate or amplify signals in a network. 
* It's used to extend the distance of a network by boosting the signal strength as it passes through. 
* Repeaters operate at the physical layer of the OSI model and are often used in long-distance communication to overcome signal degradation.

### Router: 
* A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. 
* It operates at the network layer of the OSI model and uses routing tables to determine the best path for forwarding packets. 
* Routers are essential for connecting multiple networks together, such as connecting a home network to the internet.

### Bridge: 
* A bridge is a networking device used to connect two or more network segments together at the data link layer of the OSI model. 
* Bridges operate similarly to switches but are typically used to connect different types of LANs, such as Ethernet and Wi-Fi networks, or to extend the size of a LAN.

### Gateway: 
* A gateway is a networking device that acts as an interface between different networks, translating protocols and enabling communication between devices or networks that use different communication protocols. 
* Gateways are often used to connect a local network to the internet or to integrate different types of networks, such as connecting a LAN to a WAN.
