# What is Network Cabling? 
* Cable is the medium through which information usually moves from one network device to another. 
* The type of cable chosen for a network is related to the network's topology, protocol, and size.

## Twisted Pair Cable
* A twisted-pair cabling system is a cable consisting of one or several pairs of copper wires.
* These wires are twisted together and around each other and are insulated with a dielectric polymeric compound.
* Twisting helps minimize electromagnetic radiation and resists external interference.
*comes in two varieties: shielded and unshielded. 
	*  Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) Cable
		* Unshielded twisted pair (UTP) is the most popular
		* The quality of UTP may vary from telephone-grade wire to extremely high-speed cable.
		* The cable has four pairs of wires inside the jacket. 
		* Each pair is twisted with a different number of twists per inch to help eliminate interference from adjacent pairs and other electrical devices. 
		* The tighter the twisting, the higher the supported transmission rate and the greater the cost per foot.

### Unshielded Twisted Pair Connector 
The standard connector for unshielded twisted pair cabling is an RJ-45 connector. This is a plastic connector that looks like a large telephone-style connector. A slot allows the RJ-45 to be inserted only one way. RJ stands for Registered Jack, implying that the connector follows a standard borrowed from the telephone industry. This standard designates which wire goes with each pin inside the connector. 

### Shielded Twisted Pair (STP) Cable 
* UTP cable may be susceptible to radio and electrical frequency interference (it should not be too close to electric motors, fluorescent lights, etc.).
*  If you must place cable in environments with lots of potential interference, or if you must place cable in extremely sensitive environments that may be susceptible to the electrical current in the UTP, shielded twisted pair may be the solution. 
* Shielded cables can also help to extend the maximum distance of the cables. 
* Shielded twisted pair cable is available in three different configurations: 
 	1.	Each pair of wires is individually shielded with foil. 
	2.	There is a foil or braid shield inside the jacket covering all wires (as a group). 
	3.	There is a shield around each individual pair, as well as around the entire group of wires (referred to as double shield twisted pair).

## Coaxial Cable 

* Coaxial cabling has a single copper conductor at its center. 
* A plastic layer provides insulation between the center conductor and a braided metal shield. 
* The metal shield helps to block any outside interference from fluorescent lights, motors, and other computers. 
* difficult to install.
* highly resistant to signal interference. 
*  can support greater cable lengths between network devices than twisted pair cable. 
* The two types of coaxial cabling are thick coaxial and thin coaxial.
  * Thin coaxial cable is also referred to as thinnet. 10Base2 refers to the specifications for thin coaxial cable carrying Ethernet signals. The 2 refers to the approximate maximum segment length being 200 meters. In actual fact the maximum segment length is 185 meters. Thin coaxial cable has been popular in school networks, especially linear bus networks. 
  * Thick coaxial cable is also referred to as thicknet. 10Base5 refers to the specifications for thick coaxial cable carrying Ethernet signals. The 5 refers to the maximum segment length being 500 meters. Thick coaxial cable has an extra protective plastic cover that helps keep moisture away from the center conductor. This makes thick coaxial a great choice when running longer lengths in a linear bus network. One disadvantage of thick coaxial is that it does not bend easily and is difficult to install. 
 
### Coaxial Cable Connectors 
The most common type of connector used with coaxial cables is the Bayonet-Neill-Concelman (BNC) connector. Different types of adapters are available for BNC connectors, including a T-connector,  barrel connector, and terminator. Connectors on the cable are the weakest points in any network. To help avoid problems with your network, always use the BNC connectors that crimp, rather screw, onto the cable.

## Fiber Optic Cable
 
* Fiber optic cabling consists of a center glass core surrounded by several layers of protective materials. 
* The outer insulating jacket is made of Teflon or PVC.
* It transmits light rather than electronic signals eliminating the problem of electrical interference. 
* This makes it ideal for certain environments that contain a large amount of electrical interference. 
* It has also made it the standard for connecting networks between buildings, due to its immunity to the effects of moisture and lighting. 
* has the ability to transmit signals over much longer distances at vastly greater speeds than coaxial and twisted pairs.   
* This capacity broadens communication possibilities to include services such as video conferencing and interactive services. 
* The cost of fiber optic cabling is comparable to copper cabling; however, it is more difficult to install and modify.  
* There are two common types of fiber cables -- single mode and multimode. 
	* Multimode cable has a larger diameter; however, both cables provide high bandwidth at high speeds. 
	* Single mode can provide more distance, but it is more expensive.
